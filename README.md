## Description
3D Jenga is a web-based simulation of the classic Jenga game, where players take turns removing blocks from a 3D tower and stacking them on top without causing the tower to collapse. The game features realistic physics for block movement, player turns, and game-over conditions when the tower falls.

## Features
- Realistic physics simulation of block movement.
- Player switching after each turn.
- Game over when the tower collapses or falls outside the bounds.
